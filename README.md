# automatic-cpi-weights
Action to scrape CPI weights for use in the ONS inflation calculator which are updated yearly. This uses a [node script](https://github.com/ONSvisual/automatic-cpi-weights/blob/main/run.js) which is run on a github action at 7:01 every weekday. The results are saved in this [file](https://github.com/ONSvisual/automatic-cpi-weights/blob/main/data.csv)
